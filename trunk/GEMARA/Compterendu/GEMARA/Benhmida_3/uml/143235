* Each open SQLite database is represented by a pointer to an instance of
* the opaque structure named \"sqlite3\".  It is useful to think of an sqlite3
* pointer as an object.  The [sqlite3_open()], [sqlite3_open16()], and
* [sqlite3_open_v2()] interfaces are its constructors, and [sqlite3_close()]
* and [sqlite3_close_v2()] are its destructors.  There are many other
* interfaces (such as
* [sqlite3_prepare_v2()], [sqlite3_create_function()], and
* [sqlite3_busy_timeout()] to name but three) that are methods on an
* sqlite3 object.

      comment " Methods for an open file 

* CAPI3REF: OS Interface File Virtual Methods Object
*
* Every file opened by the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] method populates an
* [sqlite3_file] object (or, more commonly, a subclass of the
* [sqlite3_file] object) with a pointer to an instance of this object.
* This object defines the methods used to perform various operations
* against the open file represented by the [sqlite3_file] object.
*
* If the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] method sets the sqlite3_file.pMethods element 
* to a non-NULL pointer, then the sqlite3_io_methods.xClose method
* may be invoked even if the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] reported that it failed.  The
* only way to prevent a call to xClose following a failed [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen]
* is for the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] to set the sqlite3_file.pMethods element
* to NULL.
*
* The flags argument to xSync may be one of [SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL] or
* [SQLITE_SYNC_FULL].  The first choice is the normal fsync().
* The second choice is a Mac OS X style fullsync.  The [SQLITE_SYNC_DATAONLY]
* flag may be ORed in to indicate that only the data of the file
* and not its inode needs to be synced.
*
* The integer values to xLock() and xUnlock() are one of
* <ul>
* <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_NONE],
* <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_SHARED],
* <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_RESERVED],
* <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_PENDING], or
* <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_EXCLUSIVE].
* </ul>
* xLock() increases the lock. xUnlock() decreases the lock.
* The xCheckReservedLock() method checks whether any database connection,
* either in this process or in some other process, is holding a RESERVED,
* PENDING, or EXCLUSIVE lock on the file.  It returns true
* if such a lock exists and false otherwise.
*
* The xFileControl() method is a generic interface that allows custom
* VFS implementations to directly control an open file using the
* [sqlite3_file_control()] interface.  The second \"op\" argument is an
* integer opcode.  The third argument is a generic pointer intended to
* point to a structure that may contain arguments or space in which to
* write return values.  Potential uses for xFileControl() might be
* functions to enable blocking locks with timeouts, to change the
* locking strategy (for example to use dot-file locks), to inquire
* about the status of a lock, or to break stale locks.  The SQLite
* core reserves all opcodes less than 100 for its own use.
* A [file control opcodes | list of opcodes] less than 100 is available.
* Applications that define a custom xFileControl method should use opcodes
* greater than 100 to avoid conflicts.  VFS implementations should
* return [SQLITE_NOTFOUND] for file control opcodes that they do not
* recognize.
*
* The xSectorSize() method returns the sector size of the
* device that underlies the file.  The sector size is the
* minimum write that can be performed without disturbing
* other bytes in the file.  The xDeviceCharacteristics()
* method returns a bit vector describing behaviors of the
* underlying device:
*
* <ul>
* <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC]
* <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC512]
* <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC1K]
* <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC2K]
* <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC4K]
* <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC8K]
* <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC16K]
* <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC32K]
* <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC64K]
* <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_SAFE_APPEND]
* <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_SEQUENTIAL]
* </ul>
*
* The SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC property means that all writes of
* any size are atomic.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMICnnn values
* mean that writes of blocks that are nnn bytes in size and
* are aligned to an address which is an integer multiple of
* nnn are atomic.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_SAFE_APPEND value means
* that when data is appended to a file, the data is appended
* first then the size of the file is extended, never the other
* way around.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_SEQUENTIAL property means that
* information is written to disk in the same order as calls
* to xWrite().
*
* If xRead() returns SQLITE_IOERR_SHORT_READ it must also fill
* in the unread portions of the buffer with zeros.  A VFS that
* fails to zero-fill short reads might seem to work.  However,
* failure to zero-fill short reads will eventually lead to
* database corruption.

      comment "* CAPI3REF: OS Interface Object
*
* An instance of the sqlite3_vfs object defines the interface between
* the SQLite core and the underlying operating system.  The \"vfs\"
* in the name of the object stands for \"virtual file system\".  See
* the [VFS | VFS documentation] for further information.
*
* The value of the iVersion field is initially 1 but may be larger in
* future versions of SQLite.  Additional fields may be appended to this
* object when the iVersion value is increased.  Note that the structure
* of the sqlite3_vfs object changes in the transaction between
* SQLite version 3.5.9 and 3.6.0 and yet the iVersion field was not
* modified.
*
* The szOsFile field is the size of the subclassed [sqlite3_file]
* structure used by this VFS.  mxPathname is the maximum length of
* a pathname in this VFS.
*
* Registered sqlite3_vfs objects are kept on a linked list formed by
* the pNext pointer.  The [sqlite3_vfs_register()]
* and [sqlite3_vfs_unregister()] interfaces manage this list
* in a thread-safe way.  The [sqlite3_vfs_find()] interface
* searches the list.  Neither the application code nor the VFS
* implementation should use the pNext pointer.
*
* The pNext field is the only field in the sqlite3_vfs
* structure that SQLite will ever modify.  SQLite will only access
* or modify this field while holding a particular static mutex.
* The application should never modify anything within the sqlite3_vfs
* object once the object has been registered.
*
* The zName field holds the name of the VFS module.  The name must
* be unique across all VFS modules.
*
* [[sqlite3_vfs.xOpen]]
* ^SQLite guarantees that the zFilename parameter to xOpen
* is either a NULL pointer or string obtained
* from xFullPathname() with an optional suffix added.
* ^If a suffix is added to the zFilename parameter, it will
* consist of a single \"-\" character followed by no more than
* 11 alphanumeric and/or \"-\" characters.
* ^SQLite further guarantees that
* the string will be valid and unchanged until xClose() is
* called. Because of the previous sentence,
* the [sqlite3_file] can safely store a pointer to the
* filename if it needs to remember the filename for some reason.
* If the zFilename parameter to xOpen is a NULL pointer then xOpen
* must invent its own temporary name for the file.  ^Whenever the 
* xFilename parameter is NULL it will also be the case that the
* flags parameter will include [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE].
*
* The flags argument to xOpen() includes all bits set in
* the flags argument to [sqlite3_open_v2()].  Or if [sqlite3_open()]
* or [sqlite3_open16()] is used, then flags includes at least
* [SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE] | [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE]. 
* If xOpen() opens a file read-only then it sets *pOutFlags to
* include [SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY].  Other bits in *pOutFlags may be set.
*
* ^(SQLite will also add one of the following flags to the xOpen()
* call, depending on the object being opened:
*
* <ul>
* <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_DB]
* <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_JOURNAL]
* <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_DB]
* <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_JOURNAL]
* <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TRANSIENT_DB]
* <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_SUBJOURNAL]
* <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MASTER_JOURNAL]
* <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_WAL]
* </ul>)^
*
* The file I/O implementation can use the object type flags to
* change the way it deals with files.  For example, an application
* that does not care about crash recovery or rollback might make
* the open of a journal file a no-op.  Writes to this journal would
* also be no-ops, and any attempt to read the journal would return
* SQLITE_IOERR.  Or the implementation might recognize that a database
* file will be doing page-aligned sector reads and writes in a random
* order and set up its I/O subsystem accordingly.
*
* SQLite might also add one of the following flags to the xOpen method:
*
* <ul>
* <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE]
* <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE]
* </ul>
*
* The [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE] flag means the file should be
* deleted when it is closed.  ^The [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE]
* will be set for TEMP databases and their journals, transient
* databases, and subjournals.
*
* ^The [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE] flag is always used in conjunction
* with the [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE] flag, which are both directly
* analogous to the O_EXCL and O_CREAT flags of the POSIX open()
* API.  The SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE flag, when paired with the 
* SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE, is used to indicate that file should always
* be created, and that it is an error if it already exists.
* It is <i>not</i> used to indicate the file should be opened 
* for exclusive access.
*
* ^At least szOsFile bytes of memory are allocated by SQLite
* to hold the  [sqlite3_file] structure passed as the third
* argument to xOpen.  The xOpen method does not have to
* allocate the structure; it should just fill it in.  Note that
* the xOpen method must set the sqlite3_file.pMethods to either
* a valid [sqlite3_io_methods] object or to NULL.  xOpen must do
* this even if the open fails.  SQLite expects that the sqlite3_file.pMethods
* element will be valid after xOpen returns regardless of the success
* or failure of the xOpen call.
*
* [[sqlite3_vfs.xAccess]]
* ^The flags argument to xAccess() may be [SQLITE_ACCESS_EXISTS]
* to test for the existence of a file, or [SQLITE_ACCESS_READWRITE] to
* test whether a file is readable and writable, or [SQLITE_ACCESS_READ]
* to test whether a file is at least readable.   The file can be a
* directory.
*
* ^SQLite will always allocate at least mxPathname+1 bytes for the
* output buffer xFullPathname.  The exact size of the output buffer
* is also passed as a parameter to both  methods. If the output buffer
* is not large enough, [SQLITE_CANTOPEN] should be returned. Since this is
* handled as a fatal error by SQLite, vfs implementations should endeavor
* to prevent this by setting mxPathname to a sufficiently large value.
*
* The xRandomness(), xSleep(), xCurrentTime(), and xCurrentTimeInt64()
* interfaces are not strictly a part of the filesystem, but they are
* included in the VFS structure for completeness.
* The xRandomness() function attempts to return nBytes bytes
* of good-quality randomness into zOut.  The return value is
* the actual number of bytes of randomness obtained.
* The xSleep() method causes the calling thread to sleep for at
* least the number of microseconds given.  ^The xCurrentTime()
* method returns a Julian Day Number for the current date and time as
* a floating point value.
* ^The xCurrentTimeInt64() method returns, as an integer, the Julian
* Day Number multiplied by 86400000 (the number of milliseconds in 
* a 24-hour day).  
* ^SQLite will use the xCurrentTimeInt64() method to get the current
* date and time if that method is available (if iVersion is 2 or 
* greater and the function pointer is not NULL) and will fall back
* to xCurrentTime() if xCurrentTimeInt64() is unavailable.
*
* ^The xSetSystemCall(), xGetSystemCall(), and xNestSystemCall() interfaces
* are not used by the SQLite core.  These optional interfaces are provided
* by some VFSes to facilitate testing of the VFS code. By overriding 
* system calls with functions under its control, a test program can
* simulate faults and error conditions that would otherwise be difficult
* or impossible to induce.  The set of system calls that can be overridden
* varies from one VFS to another, and from one version of the same VFS to the
* next.  Applications that use these interfaces must be prepared for any
* or all of these interfaces to be NULL or for their behavior to change
* from one release to the next.  Applications must not attempt to access
* any of these methods if the iVersion of the VFS is less than 3.

* and that this object is only useful to a tiny minority of applications
* with specialized memory allocation requirements.  This object is
* also used during testing of SQLite in order to specify an alternative
* memory allocator that simulates memory out-of-memory conditions in
* order to verify that SQLite recovers gracefully from such
* conditions.
*
* The xMalloc, xRealloc, and xFree methods must work like the
* malloc(), realloc() and free() functions from the standard C library.
* ^SQLite guarantees that the second argument to
* xRealloc is always a value returned by a prior call to xRoundup.
*
* xSize should return the allocated size of a memory allocation
* previously obtained from xMalloc or xRealloc.  The allocated size
* is always at least as big as the requested size but may be larger.
*
* The xRoundup method returns what would be the allocated size of
* a memory allocation given a particular requested size.  Most memory
* allocators round up memory allocations at least to the next multiple
* of 8.  Some allocators round up to a larger multiple or to a power of 2.
* Every memory allocation request coming in through [sqlite3_malloc()]
* or [sqlite3_realloc()] first calls xRoundup.  If xRoundup returns 0, 
* that causes the corresponding memory allocation to fail.
*
* The xInit method initializes the memory allocator.  For example,
* it might allocate any require mutexes or initialize internal data
* structures.  The xShutdown method is invoked (indirectly) by
* [sqlite3_shutdown()] and should deallocate any resources acquired
* by xInit.  The pAppData pointer is used as the only parameter to
* xInit and xShutdown.
*
* SQLite holds the [SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MASTER] mutex when it invokes
* the xInit method, so the xInit method need not be threadsafe.  The
* xShutdown method is only called from [sqlite3_shutdown()] so it does
* not need to be threadsafe either.  For all other methods, SQLite
* holds the [SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MEM] mutex as long as the
* [SQLITE_CONFIG_MEMSTATUS] configuration option is turned on (which
* it is by default) and so the methods are automatically serialized.
* However, if [SQLITE_CONFIG_MEMSTATUS] is disabled, then the other
* methods must be threadsafe or else make their own arrangements for
* serialization.
*
* SQLite will never invoke xInit() more than once without an intervening
* call to xShutdown().

* SQLite uses the sqlite3_value object to represent all values

* for the values it stores.  ^Values stored in sqlite3_value objects
* can be integers, floating point values, strings, BLOBs, or NULL.
*
* An sqlite3_value object may be either \"protected\" or \"unprotected\".
* Some interfaces require a protected sqlite3_value.  Other interfaces

* whether or not it requires a protected sqlite3_value.  The
* [sqlite3_value_dup()] interface can be used to construct a new 
* protected sqlite3_value from an unprotected sqlite3_value.
*
* The terms \"protected\" and \"unprotected\" refer to whether or not
* a mutex is held.  An internal mutex is held for a protected
* sqlite3_value object but no mutex is held for an unprotected
* sqlite3_value object.  If SQLite is compiled to be single-threaded
* (with [SQLITE_THREADSAFE=0] and with [sqlite3_threadsafe()] returning 0)
* or if SQLite is run in one of reduced mutex modes 
* [SQLITE_CONFIG_SINGLETHREAD] or [SQLITE_CONFIG_MULTITHREAD]
* then there is no distinction between protected and unprotected
* sqlite3_value objects and they can be used interchangeably.  However,
* for maximum code portability it is recommended that applications
* still make the distinction between protected and unprotected
* sqlite3_value objects even when not strictly required.
*
* ^The sqlite3_value objects that are passed as parameters into the

* ^The sqlite3_value object returned by

      comment "* CAPI3REF: Mutex Methods Object
*
* An instance of this structure defines the low-level routines
* used to allocate and use mutexes.
*
* Usually, the default mutex implementations provided by SQLite are
* sufficient, however the application has the option of substituting a custom
* implementation for specialized deployments or systems for which SQLite
* does not provide a suitable implementation. In this case, the application
* creates and populates an instance of this structure to pass
* to sqlite3_config() along with the [SQLITE_CONFIG_MUTEX] option.
* Additionally, an instance of this structure can be used as an
* output variable when querying the system for the current mutex
* implementation, using the [SQLITE_CONFIG_GETMUTEX] option.
*
* ^The xMutexInit method defined by this structure is invoked as
* part of system initialization by the sqlite3_initialize() function.
* ^The xMutexInit routine is called by SQLite exactly once for each
* effective call to [sqlite3_initialize()].
*
* ^The xMutexEnd method defined by this structure is invoked as
* part of system shutdown by the sqlite3_shutdown() function. The
* implementation of this method is expected to release all outstanding
* resources obtained by the mutex methods implementation, especially
* those obtained by the xMutexInit method.  ^The xMutexEnd()
* interface is invoked exactly once for each call to [sqlite3_shutdown()].
*
* ^(The remaining seven methods defined by this structure (xMutexAlloc,
* xMutexFree, xMutexEnter, xMutexTry, xMutexLeave, xMutexHeld and
* xMutexNotheld) implement the following interfaces (respectively):
*
* <ul>
*   <li>  [sqlite3_mutex_alloc()] </li>
*   <li>  [sqlite3_mutex_free()] </li>
*   <li>  [sqlite3_mutex_enter()] </li>
*   <li>  [sqlite3_mutex_try()] </li>
*   <li>  [sqlite3_mutex_leave()] </li>
*   <li>  [sqlite3_mutex_held()] </li>
*   <li>  [sqlite3_mutex_notheld()] </li>
* </ul>)^
*
* The only difference is that the public sqlite3_XXX functions enumerated
* above silently ignore any invocations that pass a NULL pointer instead
* of a valid mutex handle. The implementations of the methods defined
* by this structure are not required to handle this case, the results
* of passing a NULL pointer instead of a valid mutex handle are undefined
* (i.e. it is acceptable to provide an implementation that segfaults if
* it is passed a NULL pointer).
*
* The xMutexInit() method must be threadsafe.  It must be harmless to
* invoke xMutexInit() multiple times within the same process and without
* intervening calls to xMutexEnd().  Second and subsequent calls to
* xMutexInit() must be no-ops.
*
* xMutexInit() must not use SQLite memory allocation ([sqlite3_malloc()]
* and its associates).  Similarly, xMutexAlloc() must not use SQLite memory
* allocation for a static mutex.  ^However xMutexAlloc() may use SQLite
* memory allocation for a fast or recursive mutex.
*
* ^SQLite will invoke the xMutexEnd() method when [sqlite3_shutdown()] is
* called, but only if the prior call to xMutexInit returned SQLITE_OK.
* If xMutexInit fails in any way, it is expected to clean up after itself
* prior to returning.

      comment "* CAPI3REF: Application Defined Page Cache.
* KEYWORDS: {page cache}
*
* ^(The [sqlite3_config]([SQLITE_CONFIG_PCACHE2], ...) interface can
* register an alternative page cache implementation by passing in an 
* instance of the sqlite3_pcache_methods2 structure.)^
* In many applications, most of the heap memory allocated by 
* SQLite is used for the page cache.
* By implementing a 
* custom page cache using this API, an application can better control
* the amount of memory consumed by SQLite, the way in which 
* that memory is allocated and released, and the policies used to 
* determine exactly which parts of a database file are cached and for 
* how long.
*
* The alternative page cache mechanism is an
* extreme measure that is only needed by the most demanding applications.
* The built-in page cache is recommended for most uses.
*
* ^(The contents of the sqlite3_pcache_methods2 structure are copied to an
* internal buffer by SQLite within the call to [sqlite3_config].  Hence
* the application may discard the parameter after the call to
* [sqlite3_config()] returns.)^
*
* [[the xInit() page cache method]]
* ^(The xInit() method is called once for each effective 
* call to [sqlite3_initialize()])^
* (usually only once during the lifetime of the process). ^(The xInit()
* method is passed a copy of the sqlite3_pcache_methods2.pArg value.)^
* The intent of the xInit() method is to set up global data structures 
* required by the custom page cache implementation. 
* ^(If the xInit() method is NULL, then the 
* built-in default page cache is used instead of the application defined
* page cache.)^
*
* [[the xShutdown() page cache method]]
* ^The xShutdown() method is called by [sqlite3_shutdown()].
* It can be used to clean up 
* any outstanding resources before process shutdown, if required.
* ^The xShutdown() method may be NULL.
*
* ^SQLite automatically serializes calls to the xInit method,
* so the xInit method need not be threadsafe.  ^The
* xShutdown method is only called from [sqlite3_shutdown()] so it does
* not need to be threadsafe either.  All other methods must be threadsafe
* in multithreaded applications.
*
* ^SQLite will never invoke xInit() more than once without an intervening
* call to xShutdown().
*
* [[the xCreate() page cache methods]]
* ^SQLite invokes the xCreate() method to construct a new cache instance.
* SQLite will typically create one cache instance for each open database file,
* though this is not guaranteed. ^The
* first parameter, szPage, is the size in bytes of the pages that must
* be allocated by the cache.  ^szPage will always a power of two.  ^The
* second parameter szExtra is a number of bytes of extra storage 
* associated with each page cache entry.  ^The szExtra parameter will
* a number less than 250.  SQLite will use the
* extra szExtra bytes on each page to store metadata about the underlying
* database page on disk.  The value passed into szExtra depends
* on the SQLite version, the target platform, and how SQLite was compiled.
* ^The third argument to xCreate(), bPurgeable, is true if the cache being
* created will be used to cache database pages of a file stored on disk, or
* false if it is used for an in-memory database. The cache implementation
* does not have to do anything special based with the value of bPurgeable;
* it is purely advisory.  ^On a cache where bPurgeable is false, SQLite will
* never invoke xUnpin() except to deliberately delete a page.
* ^In other words, calls to xUnpin() on a cache with bPurgeable set to
* false will always have the \"discard\" flag set to true.  
* ^Hence, a cache created with bPurgeable false will
* never contain any unpinned pages.
*
* [[the xCachesize() page cache method]]
* ^(The xCachesize() method may be called at any time by SQLite to set the
* suggested maximum cache-size (number of pages stored by) the cache
* instance passed as the first argument. This is the value configured using
* the SQLite \"[PRAGMA cache_size]\" command.)^  As with the bPurgeable
* parameter, the implementation is not required to do anything with this
* value; it is advisory only.
*
* [[the xPagecount() page cache methods]]
* The xPagecount() method must return the number of pages currently
* stored in the cache, both pinned and unpinned.
* 
* [[the xFetch() page cache methods]]
* The xFetch() method locates a page in the cache and returns a pointer to 
* an sqlite3_pcache_page object associated with that page, or a NULL pointer.
* The pBuf element of the returned sqlite3_pcache_page object will be a
* pointer to a buffer of szPage bytes used to store the content of a 
* single database page.  The pExtra element of sqlite3_pcache_page will be
* a pointer to the szExtra bytes of extra storage that SQLite has requested
* for each entry in the page cache.
*
* The page to be fetched is determined by the key. ^The minimum key value
* is 1.  After it has been retrieved using xFetch, the page is considered
* to be \"pinned\".
*
* If the requested page is already in the page cache, then the page cache
* implementation must return a pointer to the page buffer with its content
* intact.  If the requested page is not already in the cache, then the
* cache implementation should use the value of the createFlag
* parameter to help it determined what action to take:
*
* <table border=1 width=85% align=center>
* <tr><th> createFlag <th> Behavior when page is not already in cache
* <tr><td> 0 <td> Do not allocate a new page.  Return NULL.
* <tr><td> 1 <td> Allocate a new page if it easy and convenient to do so.
*                 Otherwise return NULL.
* <tr><td> 2 <td> Make every effort to allocate a new page.  Only return
*                 NULL if allocating a new page is effectively impossible.
* </table>
*
* ^(SQLite will normally invoke xFetch() with a createFlag of 0 or 1.  SQLite
* will only use a createFlag of 2 after a prior call with a createFlag of 1
* failed.)^  In between the to xFetch() calls, SQLite may
* attempt to unpin one or more cache pages by spilling the content of
* pinned pages to disk and synching the operating system disk cache.
*
* [[the xUnpin() page cache method]]
* ^xUnpin() is called by SQLite with a pointer to a currently pinned page
* as its second argument.  If the third parameter, discard, is non-zero,
* then the page must be evicted from the cache.
* ^If the discard parameter is
* zero, then the page may be discarded or retained at the discretion of
* page cache implementation. ^The page cache implementation
* may choose to evict unpinned pages at any time.
*
* The cache must not perform any reference counting. A single 
* call to xUnpin() unpins the page regardless of the number of prior calls 
* to xFetch().
*
* [[the xRekey() page cache methods]]
* The xRekey() method is used to change the key value associated with the
* page passed as the second argument. If the cache
* previously contains an entry associated with newKey, it must be
* discarded. ^Any prior cache entry associated with newKey is guaranteed not
* to be pinned.
*
* When SQLite calls the xTruncate() method, the cache must discard all
* existing cache entries with page numbers (keys) greater than or equal
* to the value of the iLimit parameter passed to xTruncate(). If any
* of these pages are pinned, they are implicitly unpinned, meaning that
* they can be safely discarded.
*
* [[the xDestroy() page cache method]]
* ^The xDestroy() method is used to delete a cache allocated by xCreate().
* All resources associated with the specified cache should be freed. ^After
* calling the xDestroy() method, SQLite considers the [sqlite3_pcache*]
* handle invalid, and will not use it with any other sqlite3_pcache_methods2
* functions.
*
* [[the xShrink() page cache method]]
* ^SQLite invokes the xShrink() method when it wants the page cache to
* free up as much of heap memory as possible.  The page cache implementation
* is not obligated to free any memory, but well-behaved implementations should
* do their best.

      comment "* CUSTOM AUXILIARY FUNCTIONS
***********************************************************************

* CUSTOM TOKENIZERS
*
* Applications may also register custom tokenizer types. A tokenizer 
* is registered by providing fts5 with a populated instance of the 
* following structure. All structure methods must be defined, setting
* any member of the fts5_tokenizer struct to NULL leads to undefined
* behaviour. The structure methods are expected to function as follows:
*
* xCreate:
*   This function is used to allocate and initialize a tokenizer instance.
*   A tokenizer instance is required to actually tokenize text.
*
*   The first argument passed to this function is a copy of the (void*)
*   pointer provided by the application when the fts5_tokenizer object
*   was registered with FTS5 (the third argument to xCreateTokenizer()). 
*   The second and third arguments are an array of nul-terminated strings
*   containing the tokenizer arguments, if any, specified following the
*   tokenizer name as part of the CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE statement used
*   to create the FTS5 table.
*
*   The final argument is an output variable. If successful, (*ppOut) 
*   should be set to point to the new tokenizer handle and SQLITE_OK
*   returned. If an error occurs, some value other than SQLITE_OK should
*   be returned. In this case, fts5 assumes that the final value of *ppOut 
*   is undefined.
*
* xDelete:
*   This function is invoked to delete a tokenizer handle previously
*   allocated using xCreate(). Fts5 guarantees that this function will
*   be invoked exactly once for each successful call to xCreate().
*
* xTokenize:
*   This function is expected to tokenize the nText byte string indicated 
*   by argument pText. pText may or may not be nul-terminated. The first
*   argument passed to this function is a pointer to an Fts5Tokenizer object
*   returned by an earlier call to xCreate().
*
*   The second argument indicates the reason that FTS5 is requesting
*   tokenization of the supplied text. This is always one of the following
*   four values:
*
*   <ul><li> <b>FTS5_TOKENIZE_DOCUMENT</b> - A document is being inserted into
*            or removed from the FTS table. The tokenizer is being invoked to
*            determine the set of tokens to add to (or delete from) the
*            FTS index.
*
*       <li> <b>FTS5_TOKENIZE_QUERY</b> - A MATCH query is being executed 
*            against the FTS index. The tokenizer is being called to tokenize 
*            a bareword or quoted string specified as part of the query.
*
*       <li> <b>(FTS5_TOKENIZE_QUERY | FTS5_TOKENIZE_PREFIX)</b> - Same as
*            FTS5_TOKENIZE_QUERY, except that the bareword or quoted string is
*            followed by a \"*\" character, indicating that the last token
*            returned by the tokenizer will be treated as a token prefix.
*
*       <li> <b>FTS5_TOKENIZE_AUX</b> - The tokenizer is being invoked to 
*            satisfy an fts5_api.xTokenize() request made by an auxiliary
*            function. Or an fts5_api.xColumnSize() request made by the same
*            on a columnsize=0 database.  
*   </ul>
*
*   For each token in the input string, the supplied callback xToken() must
*   be invoked. The first argument to it should be a copy of the pointer
*   passed as the second argument to xTokenize(). The third and fourth
*   arguments are a pointer to a buffer containing the token text, and the
*   size of the token in bytes. The 4th and 5th arguments are the byte offsets
*   of the first byte of and first byte immediately following the text from
*   which the token is derived within the input.
*
*   The second argument passed to the xToken() callback (\"tflags\") should
*   normally be set to 0. The exception is if the tokenizer supports 
*   synonyms. In this case see the discussion below for details.
*
*   FTS5 assumes the xToken() callback is invoked for each token in the 
*   order that they occur within the input text.
*
*   If an xToken() callback returns any value other than SQLITE_OK, then
*   the tokenization should be abandoned and the xTokenize() method should
*   immediately return a copy of the xToken() return value. Or, if the
*   input buffer is exhausted, xTokenize() should return SQLITE_OK. Finally,
*   if an error occurs with the xTokenize() implementation itself, it
*   may abandon the tokenization and return any error code other than
*   SQLITE_OK or SQLITE_DONE.
*
* SYNONYM SUPPORT
*
*   Custom tokenizers may also support synonyms. Consider a case in which a
*   user wishes to query for a phrase such as \"first place\". Using the 
*   built-in tokenizers, the FTS5 query 'first + place' will match instances
*   of \"first place\" within the document set, but not alternative forms
*   such as \"1st place\". In some applications, it would be better to match
*   all instances of \"first place\" or \"1st place\" regardless of which form
*   the user specified in the MATCH query text.
*
*   There are several ways to approach this in FTS5:
*
*   <ol><li> By mapping all synonyms to a single token. In this case, the 
*            In the above example, this means that the tokenizer returns the
*            same token for inputs \"first\" and \"1st\". Say that token is in
*            fact \"first\", so that when the user inserts the document \"I won
*            1st place\" entries are added to the index for tokens \"i\", \"won\",
*            \"first\" and \"place\". If the user then queries for '1st + place',
*            the tokenizer substitutes \"first\" for \"1st\" and the query works
*            as expected.
*
*       <li> By adding multiple synonyms for a single term to the FTS index.
*            In this case, when tokenizing query text, the tokenizer may 
*            provide multiple synonyms for a single term within the document.
*            FTS5 then queries the index for each synonym individually. For
*            example, faced with the query:
*
*   <codeblock>
*     ... MATCH 'first place'</codeblock>
*
*            the tokenizer offers both \"1st\" and \"first\" as synonyms for the
*            first token in the MATCH query and FTS5 effectively runs a query 
*            similar to:
*
*   <codeblock>
*     ... MATCH '(first OR 1st) place'</codeblock>
*
*            except that, for the purposes of auxiliary functions, the query
*            still appears to contain just two phrases - \"(first OR 1st)\" 
*            being treated as a single phrase.
*
*       <li> By adding multiple synonyms for a single term to the FTS index.
*            Using this method, when tokenizing document text, the tokenizer
*            provides multiple synonyms for each token. So that when a 
*            document such as \"I won first place\" is tokenized, entries are
*            added to the FTS index for \"i\", \"won\", \"first\", \"1st\" and
*            \"place\".
*
*            This way, even if the tokenizer does not provide synonyms
*            when tokenizing query text (it should not - to do would be
*            inefficient), it doesn't matter if the user queries for 
*            'first + place' or '1st + place', as there are entires in the
*            FTS index corresponding to both forms of the first token.
*   </ol>
*
*   Whether it is parsing document or query text, any call to xToken that
*   specifies a <i>tflags</i> argument with the FTS5_TOKEN_COLOCATED bit
*   is considered to supply a synonym for the previous token. For example,
*   when parsing the document \"I won first place\", a tokenizer that supports
*   synonyms would call xToken() 5 times, as follows:
*
*   <codeblock>
*       xToken(pCtx, 0, \"i\",                      1,  0,  1);
*       xToken(pCtx, 0, \"won\",                    3,  2,  5);
*       xToken(pCtx, 0, \"first\",                  5,  6, 11);
*       xToken(pCtx, FTS5_TOKEN_COLOCATED, \"1st\", 3,  6, 11);
*       xToken(pCtx, 0, \"place\",                  5, 12, 17);
*</codeblock>
*
*   It is an error to specify the FTS5_TOKEN_COLOCATED flag the first time
*   xToken() is called. Multiple synonyms may be specified for a single token
*   by making multiple calls to xToken(FTS5_TOKEN_COLOCATED) in sequence. 
*   There is no limit to the number of synonyms that may be provided for a
*   single token.
*
*   In many cases, method (1) above is the best approach. It does not add 
*   extra data to the FTS index or require FTS5 to query for multiple terms,
*   so it is efficient in terms of disk space and query speed. However, it
*   does not support prefix queries very well. If, as suggested above, the
*   token \"first\" is subsituted for \"1st\" by the tokenizer, then the query:
*
*   <codeblock>
*     ... MATCH '1s*'</codeblock>
*
*   will not match documents that contain the token \"1st\" (as the tokenizer
*   will probably not map \"1s\" to any prefix of \"first\").
*
*   For full prefix support, method (3) may be preferred. In this case, 
*   because the index contains entries for both \"first\" and \"1st\", prefix
*   queries such as 'fi*' or '1s*' will match correctly. However, because
*   extra entries are added to the FTS index, this method uses more space
*   within the database.
*
*   Method (2) offers a midpoint between (1) and (3). Using this method,
*   a query such as '1s*' will match documents that contain the literal 
*   token \"1st\", but not \"first\" (assuming the tokenizer is not able to
*   provide synonyms for prefixes). However, a non-prefix query like '1st'
*   will match against \"1st\" and \"first\". This method does not require
*   extra disk space, as no extra entries are added to the FTS index. 
*   On the other hand, it may require more CPU cycles to run MATCH queries,
*   as separate queries of the FTS index are required for each synonym.
*
*   When using methods (2) or (3), it is important that the tokenizer only
*   provide synonyms when tokenizing document text (method (2)) or query
*   text (method (3)), not both. Doing so will not cause any errors, but is
*   inefficient.
